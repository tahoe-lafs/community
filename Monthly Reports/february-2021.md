## February 2021

This report was produced by the Community Manager and covers discussions and decisions from February 1, 2021 to February 28, 2021.

The aesthetic has been streamlined from last month's :)

+ Whenever possible, titles/roles are mentioned alongside names
+ Governance was simple but transparent, and all decisions can be found on this public repo
+ Although 1-on-1 discussions occurred, the results of these discussions were presented for discussion and ultimately published
+ Any community member can comment on these decisions by means of a pull request
