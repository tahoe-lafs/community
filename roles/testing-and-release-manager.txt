During your kickoff meeting, we ask that you cover the following topics:

Overview of Tahoe-LAFS, ensuring that T & R has everything they need to learn the tool
Agreement upon method and frequency of communications (Signal, a forum you may manage, etc.)
Schedule at minimum weekly check-in meetings to monitor progress and troubleshoot
(these can be dialed back after the working relationship is better established)
Working draft of goals/deliverables you hope for T & R to complete during their 
6 months with you, to be updated as things progress

Draft Schedule for Six months

"The release process is documented and repeatable to the extent that someone new
to the project is able to independently generate the complete set of artifacts
required for a release."

02.04.2021 - Possible objectives over the next 5 months:

        1) Improve onboarding, using his own experience as a reflection point
            Has already noticed missing or broken paths/libraries needing update  
        2) Create or improve documentation for set-up, usage, installation
        3) Test and releasing work 
            Improve unit testing 
            Improve integration tests; perhaps look into i2p/Tor 
            Automation of processes in GitHub Actions/CI 
            
Other things to keep in mind:

    Shoot for a deterministic build (go through it and spit out some artifact)
    Everything except the Git tag; not the signing
    Sign Git
    Sign artifacts
    upload to PiPy 
    upload to Tahoe-LAFS
