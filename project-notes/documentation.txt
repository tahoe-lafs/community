Documentation improvements suggestions
    Less, and better written
    For now, start with topic guides
        Installation
        Consuming storage
        Providing storage
        How to run a friend net 
        Running hybrid local cloud grid, with a backup in the cloud
        Integrating Tahoe-LAFS as a storage layer in your app
    As documentation is written/tested, it can reveal ways in which Tahoe can be 
    improved, so it's a good opportunity to generate more tickets

TODO:
What specific improvements do we want to see in the documentation?
Might also be good to integrate some kind of CI w/Sphinx
I have a note that we use UTF-8, should that be noted anywhere or is already?
Developer documentation should also be worked on
We use Sphinx and we use it for CLI not API; it was chosen because of Python

Notes from Google Season of Docs should go here:
