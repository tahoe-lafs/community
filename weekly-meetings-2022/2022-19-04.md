URGENT:

GOVERNANCE/DISCUSSION:
Thoughts on Greg and the Dev Rel position; Tahoe's future
- How many hours is he going to put into it
- First task for Greg:
    - PMing the process for making the architecture diagram
    - Syncing the engineers with each other, creating a roadmap and onboarding/coordinating new members
- And going forward
    - Migrate us to GitLab (good task for Jr Dev)
    - Should we retrofit new primitives or have some kind of cohesive design situation, and have new capabilities/CRDT?
        - Good to have some kind of multi-writer capability
- Developer Advocate/Dev Rel:
    - Goal is to get more people to use Tahoe
- Prepare for ToB meeting next week/brainstorm on other needs within the project
    - One idea: make a thing that speaks a popular protcol to make it easier to integrate, possibly memcached, where you get to decide the keys
    - Anything using storage could benefit from using storage, could benefit and make that more private
    - Without GBS, those clients become hard to write
    - currently limited to desktop apps because of a lack of good clients
    - Finding a good desktop app
    - GBS is coming, and we need someone who is excited to use it in that way
    - How long till we can use GBS?
        - So check on this and see how soon it will happen
        - Could we get help with this?
- Sajith's role
    - Find out what he's interested in
    - Helping out GBS stuff with Itamar, would bring him up as a dev
    - things like a mobile client etc. (where you don't have to use foolscap)
    - Pick up the Trac migration (Fenn and JP were also interested)
    - Itamar working on HTTPS APIs
