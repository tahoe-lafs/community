## Create Topic Guides for New Users - Tahoe-LAFS

### About Tahoe-LAFS

Privacy by design.

#### We have been around since 2007.
Tahoe-LAFS has been in existence since 2007, founded by a group of contributors who were extremely technically savvy.
We are now in 2021 and we are still in use, proving that privacy never goes out of style.
Tahoe-LAFS' use cases include encrypted file storage for journalists under surveillance and secure file storage for individuals.
However,  of potential new users with global access who could benefit from privacy-preserving FOSS that is available 
Additionally, these new users, once introduced to Tahoe-LAFS, would see its benefit and begin hacking on it. It can be added to the storage layer of apps.
We believe having new documentation will allow more people to make use of Tahoe-LAFS' encryption capabilities and build their own projects on top of it.
For this project, we are heavily focused on making sure the first three guides are as user-friendly and welcoming as possible,
as we feel that the current user base would have no issues following our current documentation.
The second set of guides does not currently exist.

## Project Scope and Milestones
Tahoe-LAFS can appear a bit arcane to the outsider, and we have organized the project to provide for a reasonable learning curve.
The scope of the project will be six topic guides of increasing technical difficulty. These topic guides will be written in two phases.
The first phase is meant to familiarize a technical writer with Tahoe-LAFS' most basic operations, and the second phase is more challenging,
requiring not just technical skill but also the Tahoe-LAFS knowledge gained in the first phase.

### Phase 1

#### Milestone 1 (approx. 4-6 weeks)

 - Audit existing documentation against the goals of the first set of
   guides, being in close communication with Tahoe-LAFS' mentor
 - Write first set of guides, on the three most basic Tahoe-LAFS
   functions, including screenshots when appropriate:
	 - Installation
	 - Consuming Storage
	 - Providing Storage

#### Milestone 2 and first checkpoint (approx. 1-2 weeks)

 - Guides will be tested for completeness and accuracy by Tahoe-LAFS
   community members
 - Rewrites/edits

#### Milestone 3 (approx. 6-8 weeks)

 - Audit existing documentation with goals of second set of topics
 - Write second set of guides, on more sophisticated Tahoe-LAFS
   functions, including screenshots when appropriate
	 - How to run a friend net
	 - Running hybrid local cloud grid, with a backup in the cloud
	 - Integrating Tahoe-LAFS as a storage layer in your app

#### Milestone 4 and second checkpoint (approx. 1-2 weeks)

 - Guides will be tested for completeness and accuracy by Tahoe-LAFS
   community members
 - Rewrites/edits

#### Milestone 5 (approx. 1-2 weeks)
			
 - Go through the documentation that was not used to produce the topic
   guides and organize for relevance

#### Milestone 6 (approx. 1-2 weeks)

 - Collect project learnings
 - Create a roadmap for future projects

### How weâ€™ll measure success
We'll measure success along the following criteria:

 - Feedback from reviewers at Milestone 2
 - Feedback from reviewers at Milestone 4
 - Milestone 6 produces a Road Map for the next round of documentation
   projects
 - Views on our Discourse

##  Proposed Budget
The bulk of our budget would go to our technical writer, with stipends to be given to volunteers from the community 
who provide exemplary support, particularly in Milestones 2 & 4.

Budget item | Amount(USD) | Running Total(USD) | Notes/justifications
------------|--------|---------------|---------------------
Technical writer audit, update, test, and publish new topic guides for Tahoe-LAFS | 9,000.00 | 9000.00
Volunteer stipends  | 1000 | 10,000.00 | 2 volunteer stipends x 500 each
TOTAL |  | 10,000.00 |
## Skills needed

Ability to communicate issues and questions as they arise, via IRC or Slack.

Experience in information architecture or document auditing would be useful,
in addition to experience working with and using decentralized and P2P technologies.

Past experience with installing Tahoe-LAFS or contributing to Tahoe-LAFS is a plus.
Take a look at [our current installation guide](https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html)
and imagine if you can make improvements to it.

We use `Sphinx` and you will naturally be working on our public repo.

#### Additional information

We know our writers are skilled and capable, but sometimes issues or roadblocks might arise. 
So we expect our writers to communicate with us in a timely manner.
Long absences or unresponsiveness might result in termination of the relationship. 
Additionally, writers are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
