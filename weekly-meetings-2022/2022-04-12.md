GOVERNANCE/DISCUSSION:  
- We meet Greg - [Discussion and transcript here:](https://grain.com/share/recording/03e9bf10-01a4-4307-87e8-c1708f10e03f/h9HmN5ujRQeMZEj8iUUxbtZpdF1Ysl0qLRboTGhv)
    - Title intros  
    - Background/story/questions to start (Greg)  
        - Pming and IT management for bulk of career
        - Interim CEO of managed services provider
        - Experiences managing both waterfall and Agile, with remote developers/hybrid
        - Resigned because had reached a limit in the organization and wanted new challenges
    - Questions from Greg:  
        - Greg: Don't make presumptions about the way a team is working/how does Tahoe work?
            - M-L: no methodology, quasi-Agile, loosey goosey, respect people's time, have one meeting per week
            - meejah: was bigger when it was an LA project, more people working on it; mostly JP and meejah working on it
        - Greg: Is the decrease in formality a net negative or a net positive for the project?
            - meejah: Itamar likely suffers the most due to the lack of structure
            - meejah: it would be better if myself and JP could work on the project simultaneously
            - meejah: It can be really productive to do your own thing; other people might disagree if it's not been agreed what is and isn't productive
            - meejah: A bit more structure would be more beneficial; the more people that are consistently involved with be more useful
        - Greg: wants to make sure that there isn't too much management
    - M-L: What is his interpretation/imagining of the role?  
        - It feels like there's a consensus for a need for some structure or oversight, but can't predict what that looks like, until I've seen the team work together for a while, understand who the stakeholders are and how the team works together. 
        - Short term - improve visibility so the team members can see where each other is meeting
        - Directing people to a North Star, and getting through the backlog
        - No dogmatic approach, no one right way to manage a team/project; needs to flex to the needs of the organization (or disorganization)
        - It's continually evolving
    - Preferred tools/technologies (any form of stack, any workflows, hacks, etc.)  
        - Would not be a material contributor to the project ("no developer chops")
        - Less technology is better; something like Jira is too much overhead
        - Prefers Kanban; finds it easy, light lift
        - Existing technologies that need to be leveraged better or to be deprecated
        - Trac shows a lot of work to be deprecated or cancelled
        - Wants to work with whatever the team wants to work with
        - M-L: IRC, GitLab, mailing list is the informal consensus for the next stack
            - Tor's setup self-hosted, GitLab/GitHub, privacy tool, all OS, discussions in public
                - Find and achieve parity
        - meejah: lots of useful information and discussion in the Trac, even if we're moving off of it soon
        - Trac is still part of our workflow as we reference ticket numbers in our GitHub
        - Good to support Open Source products and also impactful for the community
    - What interests him about working on the project?  
        - Privacy is good; I'm all for it. I have a strong interest in topics such as disinformation mitigation and how to communicate truths. Having a decentralized storage for data is a prerequisite to that.
        - Not just about contributing code, it's about using the project, as that is a part of contribution
    - Is there any work or task he finds challenging, and similarly what does he predict he will find challenging about this role?  
        - No coding
        - The challenge will be remaining focused on oversight and to avoid getting drawn into the specifics too deeply; setting boundaries between I should be doing and what the project maintainers should be doing
        - It seems that there is currently a lot of overlap in people and tasks and that's appropriate
        - It seems that there might be a cultural struggle re: the overlaps
        - Currently speculative, since he hasn't gotten to know the team yet
        - M-L asks about "a time you failed": contextually, a former direct supervisor wanted a tool and suggested a tool, and he said that tool doesn't do what I want, and we got into a back and forth, where we both thought we were right and butted heads for a long time. The mistake was in not clarifying with adequate granularity what his tools were. Greg believed the tool fulfilled the requirements, however, the supervisor hadn't explicitly expressed the needs of the tool.
        - Comfortable navigating in the dark, and figuring things out
    - What particular strengths does he think he will bring to the project, and where does the project overlap with personal interests/mission?  
        - Strengths: like to think 2 or 3 steps ahead, and look down the road, and how a given task initiative and how the momentum of the team is moving or not moving towards that goal
        - I like to position myself as a generalist, I think of myself as a strong manager with broad technical interest. Thinking of how things tie together is how I could bring something useful
    - Very comfortable with hiring, onboarding, PIPs, running standups/1:1/Scrummaster 
    - Not comfortable with: Biz Dev, sales and marketing, not a salesman, can talk the talk and present a good face, but not into generating monetizable leads
        - Presentation skills, comfortable with that
        - Understand the politics of speaking to present things in a digestable way to the intended audience
    - Comfortable strategizing the around a sales initiative
    - meejah: Comfortable that we work in the open?
        - Yes, transparency is important to me
        - Things might be missing from the public face of the project
        - Nothing that I see from the overall philosophy raises any red flags for me

    - Greg questions:
        - What would be the glossary for the project?
            - Core technical terms: 
                - Capability theory
                - Shares, blocks, segments
                - Encryption
                - Error Correction schemes
        - meejah suggests reading erights.org to get more info
        - Biggest challenge:
            - meejah: old project, meets legacy code definition, set people's expectations about it being a nice modern python 3 project with well-factored code. It's got dark corners, so there's a lot of documentation and a lot of code, and those people aren't around anymore
            - meejah: hiring a tech writer: need the most experienced developers to help with that, and their time is better spent with developing
            - Greg: wants to look at documentation
            - Greg's best value add: coordinate people's time effectively, so that people work together, such as with pair programming or making sure people's project days overlap
            - Greg asks, do we need active management or automated workflow? moreso the latter; developers are bad at bugging each other for stuff like that
            - meejah: notice and bug people about a stale PR
            - Greg: which would make the project move faster in calendar time, so shrinking calendar time would be a huge improvement

- BASICS
    - We should discuss some other time
    - meejah says he didn't like the hiring process
    - May-Lee thought there was a lot of friction due to having to bring in another organization's processes
