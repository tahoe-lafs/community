URGENT:
* OpenCollective needs top-up to continue work from SnakeDevs contractors (May-Lee, <10 mins)
    * TODO: Determine how much to put into OpenCollective and at which intervals
    * Suggestion: Ahead of OpenCollective invoice, or simultaneous with it, request itemized invoices from Itamar and Gregg (Jean-Paul's invoices are a good example of transparent but not unwieldy itemization). OpenCollective shows limited information, so if this information is already being turned into the platform, request CC to Julianne/May-Lee/etc.
    * For reference, these are the invoices which have been paid out of OpenCollective: https://opencollective.com/tahoe-lafs/expenses?offset=0
