INCOMPLETE MINUTES - DRAFT

Deferred items:

 
   Libera.Chat IRC cloaks
        - Should we adopt IRC cloaks?
        - We could adopt cloaks like "tahoe-lafs/team/<nick>" and
          "tahoe-lafs/bot/<nick>" that show project affilation.
        - exarkun, maylee, meejah, or sajith should be able to ask for

Friday, May 28

PRESENT: Jean-Paul, Sajith, May-Lee

NON-GOVERNANCE
Web Dev update: 
    Onboarding doc seems relatively comprehensive
        https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/3/pad/edit/f130ce6cd2dee0a329f847f5982e8951/
    A checklist is good a the beginning, but we need to communicate the broader
    vision of Tahoe (perhaps this will come out of the Summit)
    Anxhelo (web dev) is making tickets, doing PRs, recreating assets
    We might want to keep the Tahoe logo, but want it updated
        Agree that we like it
        Jean-Paul (core dev) wonders what the symbology/story of it is
        May-Lee (community manager) wants it to be "more metal"
Waiting on Radicle VCS to speak at a Lightning Talk:
    https://radicle.xyz/ 
    FOSS P2P code collaboration built with Git and decentralized with opt-in
    Ethereum 
Other non-governance topics?
    May-Lee (community manager) recommends 2.5 hr podcast on Moon Math:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycK3AUTdl1w
    SWAG - part of contributor/fan pipeline
        Sajith (core dev) shares cautionary tale of `curl` sticker swag:
            https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/05/28/giving-away-an-insane-amount-of-curl-stickers/
        Jean-Paul (core dev) "all swag is useless" (stickers, mugs)
            brief tour of JP's useless sticker collection
            suggestions for branded security hardware: 
                Yubi keys
                pre-loaded flash drives that are a self-contained Tahoe instance
                plug in, have a Tahoe node, works on all major platforms

GOVERNANCE
    Items decided for Tuesday's meeting
    All items should be framed in the form of: what is the outcome we want?

TBD but must be scheduled at GOVERNANCE eventually:
    FOSdem meetings should be scheduled
    Getting a new domain/getting rights to our current domain
        Domain not urgent until needed for infra
        But yea, mailing list 
        Worst case scenario, we get YET ANOTHER domain ahead of getting permissions
        We currently have three domain names pointing towards us 
        Pro-tip: once your organization gets a domain name that is visited by your 
        users, you MUST NEVER LET IT FALL INTO ENEMY HANDS or they will defile it mightily
  
Tuesday, May 25
_______________________________________________________________________
PRESENT: May-Lee, Sajith, meejah, Jean-Paul, teratorn, Anxhelo

Today we all got to meet Anxhelo (new Web Dev from BASICS)
*New Contributor* teratorn from the IRC also joined

GOVERNANCE
    Community channel - ideas and when to vote?
        meejah (core dev) made a ticket: https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3721
        We have moved off freenode.net and onto Libera.chat
        The Slack bridge is broken and may never come back

    GBS RfP https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/3/pad/edit/39b52aeb24c546044f22c6e111252220/
        Everyone has been asked to look at the scope and try group items in a 
        manner that would be digestible for a security firm 
     
OTHER DOCS TO REVIEW (no urgency):
Web Dev Onboarding doc was commented on and put into use on Wednesday, May 26
Web Dev Onboarding process
  https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/3/pad/edit/441aaca21dad3f0a75cf6ef0b482af6f/

Testing and Release Manager retrospective - still being processed
  https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/3/pad/edit/e4ba29febafd61c15f1e1de9d461a258/

Friday, May 21
_______________________________________________________________________
PRESENT: Sajith, May-Lee

LIGHTNING TALK w/ Jason Snell rescheduled; possible collaboration with Michelle
Ledddon and Julia-Scott Stevenson

INSPO/Revolution vibes:
Freenode kerfuffle? Actions taken:
  - #tahoe-lafs on Libera.chat
  - need to do a little governance on this one, likely Tuesday
  - There's also https://tahoe-lafs.zulipchat.com, if not as an IRC
    alternative, as a Slack alternative.
  - OFTC might be a good choice, but I2P has control of #tahoe-lafs

Tuesday, May 18
_______________________________________________________________________

Jean-Paul and Sajith attended and discussed the below items:

ROADMAP

We need to discuss and document the roadmap somewhere.  Trac is not
the preferred place to hash out the roadmap.  Perhaps we could use
the community repository for this.

Some wishes for the future (other than shipping Python 3 port):

  1. Shipping Grid Manager
  2. Non-foolscap storage servers and introducer
  3. Re-engineering the API
  4. The WUI should be separated from Tahoe-LAFS proper
  5. Improving responsiveness

We could aim for 1 and 2 in 2020.  We need to discuss 3 and 4.

Regarding responsiveness: tahoe-lafs "feels" slow from a user
perspective.  As in, `tahoe --help` takes a little bit of time just to
print the help message.
  
Regarding ZKAP, Chrome extension, other integrations, etc: at the
moment, we do not have enough information in order to discuss them.

Regarding netifaces: maintenance might be taken up by a team within
Red Hat.  That is good news.

Did not discuss onboarding doc or retrospective doc, since they
require May-Lee's presence.

Regarding tickets: we looked at the tickets from the past week.

- Python 3 porting: 6 new tickets, 4 closed (itamarst)
- Others:
   - #3710: "tahoe get" emits HTML for dircaps (meejah)
   - #3711: release checklist update (meejah)
   - #3713: README update (exarkun)
   - #3712: Nix packaging update (exarkun)

Not sure if #3710 ("tahoe get <dircap>" emits HTML), not sure if that
behavior is a regression or not.  #3711, #3712, and #3713 are closed,
with corresponding pull requests.

Old timey ticket: We looked at #1942 ("Replace google chart in wui
with d3.js: it leaks information")

  https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/1942

This was interesting because there ever was a chart in the web UI was
news to me.  Ticket #1942 was closed today, with the resolution that
we will not fix it.  Google Chart API usage has been long removed, the
wui has not produced any charts in a long time, and the WUI should be
a separate project anyway.


Friday, May 14
_______________________________________________________________________
SHOUT OUT TO ITAMAR (AGAIN):
all integration tests now pass on python 3 too
(at this point you should just assume all code has to be python 3 compatible)

Sajith (core dev) has volunteered to run the meeting Tuesday

Testing and Release Manager contract ended by BASICS/Internews
  
INSPO AND ANTI-ANTI-PATTERNING 
  NICE. A lot of good work got done this week, healthy PRs and good channel
  convos :)

  LoneTech is a new contributor!

  Rants and discussions:
    Current newfangled fad of meddling kids trying to get Typing into Python
    All of our complex testing needs (Windows, user testing, coverage complete?)
    Implementing a Tahoe-LAFS browser extension and what that would entail

  Conferences:
    May-Lee (community manager) wants to start sending our folks to Conferences
    M-L suggested Sajith represent us/present at FOSSdem 2022,
    suggested Jean-Paul (core dev) represent us/present at Haskell Love 2021
    Also believes we should find someone(s) for EuroPython/PyConDE 2021
  
  Tahoe-LAFS Summit 2021:
   Suggested to add a day or so on either end of the LA Summit in Berlin
   Would be an efficient use of resources for Core Team 
   Would not replace a larger, more general Summit, either online or IRL
    Discussion: gather.town, theonline.town as virtual summit tools

  Professional development:
    May-Lee wants to know if people want PD/what would they want?
    No promises, but can present the idea to the Board 

Tuesday, May 11
_______________________________________________________________________
GOVERNANCE
* SHOUT OUT TO ITAMAR 
    Python 3 porting milestone: ALL UNIT TESTS PASS ON PYTHON 3
    (don't get too excited; we're still porting ;)

* Release 1.15.1 completed internally; brought up to date

* Next Lightning Talk May 21: Jason Snell/EEG Music demo/Talk: privacy and security issues
  of brain interface devices (collaborated with Michelle Leddon, Julia Scott-Stevenson as 
  part of the Assembly of Privacy Doxographers and Liz/Least Authority)
  https://leastauthority.com/blog/privy-to-will-be-featured-at-copenhagen-international-documentary-film-festival/

* UPDATES:
    Liz (Board) receptive to podcast idea
    May-Lee (community manager) working on Discourse/OAuth with Sajith (core dev)
    Jitsi issue being worked on

* DISCUSSION: Testing and Release Manager's performance since daily stand-ups started

Friday, May 7
_______________________________________________________________________
PRESENTATION
* Pantherscore.com w/Hernán Romero (currently Product Manager at Yoti)
    Project now in Beta; started in October 2020
    Uses NLP to weight specific privacy policy clauses and assigns and generates a score
    Other strategies: examines SDKs, past breaches, Firefox's TL;DR
    Goal: show the worst offenders, promote good products (Jitsi, Signal), make
    security accessible, vs. technical, dry or "scary"; "making privacy convenient"
    Other key takeaways:
        80% of consumers worried about security; 20% take minimum action 
        Still a lot of discrepancies between policies and intentions/practices 
        Communities can fill in the gaps by providing conversation around issues
        GDPR and issues of portability/deletion should be considered bare minimum

DISCUSSION - stale PRs up for review
* (thank you to meejah (core dev) and Jean-Paul (core dev) for engaging on this)
    Make PRs smaller, easier to review, easier to move on from
        Smaller could mean thinking about how the feature could be split up into 
        smaller branches of minimally executable implementations
    Scheduling - things get lost in the cracks; so circling back for sync appts 
    General organizational issue with dispersed attention/unclear priorities 

Tuesday, May 4
_______________________________________________________________________
GOVERNANCE
* New Web Dev chosen for the next three months via the Internews/BASICS program

* Python 3 porting discussion
    Ajibola (testing and release manager) to create Release Automation Plan
    "Kitchen sink"-style Security Audit RfP to go out ASAP (to prevent blocking
    implementation)
    Create a list of distros and get into them 
    Decide if we want to drop any platforms
    https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/2376/workflows/a3f39a12-ae32-4e85-8695-b9264340628b
    Discussion: How do we express errors more productively?
    https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3695

* Reorganizing Trac Roadmap
    https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/roadmap
    For the time being, avoid due dates on milestones unless foreseeably clear

APRIL 
Friday, April 30
_______________________________________________________________________
BIKESHED
* SnakeDev meeting  
    Liz (Board), May-Lee (community manager), Jean-Paul (core dev) and Itamar 
    (contributor) met with Pete Fein from SnakeDevs to chat about Python 3 porting
    progress and next steps.

* Documentation 
    There's no right way to do it
    BUT we need a shared vision that is written down somewhere and will act as a 
    metric of progress


Tuesday, April 27
_______________________________________________________________________
GOVERNANCE

* Discussion on reaching consensus within the project
    Decided against quorum right now because there are only 3 - 4 people to check in on
    Small community allows for quicker moves
    Rough consensus is basically working so we just need to keep improving 
    documentation and directing attention
    Project Leader Role could help with consensus
    Have some formalized agreements for more contentious areas

* Side discussion:
    How do contributors enter and advance in the project?
    At what point do you become a Core Developer?
        Core Devs have the power to commit to the repo
        A checklist: EX: "knows that they need help and knows who to ask"
    Meejah (Core Dev) suggestion: form of snippets library or summary (a Gist?)
    Other onboarding issues - May-Lee (Community Manager) has some working docs 
    in the Cryptpad

* Should we forget about supporting Python 2.7 for Windows?
    We will use 32 bit windows to keep the CI running until the Python 3 port is complete
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/pull/1047
    Side discussion: Separation of Client and Server (need to be separated)

TICKETS

* Blast from the past: discuss and select from logo designs (2010)
  Ticket: https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/1185

OTHER

* First Lightning Talk May 7 16:30 UTC +2/CEST
  Scribe needed May 18

* Update: mailing list  
    Sajith (CORE DEV) is in close communication with Warner/Liz (Board) and OSU
    OSL to continue working on a good outcome for the mailing list.
    

Friday, April 23
_______________________________________________________________________

* Ajibola update (Testing and Release Manager)
    He is encouraged to jot down the narrative of his experience weekly
    Looking for ways to automate the release process, but can't be fully automated 
    Commended for his resilience tbh

* Decision on Web Developer's priorities over 3 months:
    A new static web presence with relevant links (news, etc.)
    Some asset management strategy for existing assets (not new assets)
    Stretch goal: Improve web front end 

* https://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2021-April/010012.html
    Jean-Paul (core dev) to be in contact with technical limitations 
    Tahoe-LAFS can't do what they want it to do
    However, some good discussion points raised:
        Share limit, share search, share placement, mobile phone failure profile, 
        data availability, scalability, security of friendnets, NAT traversal

* We have two meetings a week and Tuesday's has all the Core team
    Tuesdays we'll prioritize governance decisions 
    Friday we'll play more loosey goosey and do some bikeshedding and presentations


Tuesday, April 20
_______________________________________________________________________

* Season of Docs unsuccessful
    We are better prepared to apply another time or do our own project
    Sajith (core dev) has also been making moves here:
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/pull/1030

* Web Dev evaluation:
    Jean-Paul (core dev) and May-Lee (community manager) to interview 3 candidates
    Bigger questions: How do we evaluate future candidates?
        Questions and criteria should be decided beforehand
        Most at the meeting did not agree with using take-home evaluation
        Voting could have gone more smoothly; better tool/clearer workflow
        No mechanism to break ties; fallback "squishy feelings"

* Ticket triage goes to Sajith for April 

* OSU OSL needs some settings but also we are back to figuring out what to do 
    about the domain tahoe-lafs.org

Friday, April 16
_______________________________________________________________________

* Web Dev hiring
    Review submissions and fill out evaluation on Cryptpad
        https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/web-design
    Should be done by Tuesday so we can discuss if needed

* Ticket triage scheduled for Tuesday 

* Ajibola (Testing and Release) begins designing automated release process 
    Discussion of using a script and which parts are automatable
        Isolation of manual parts: branching, PR, review, GPG signing


Tuesday, April 13
_______________________________________________________________________

* Mailing list 
    Sajith (core dev) has reached out to OSU OSL and we will pay them a donation 
    of $10/mo if they can help us 
    We'll try to announce end-of-life for tahoe-announce and tahoe-weekly-news 

* Hard deadline for Web Dev role submission is 18:00 UTC Friday
    PRs will be merged and then everyone can look at the submissions
    Evaluation spreadsheet on CryptPad
   
* Tahoe-LAFS will be moving sensitive, internal documents from Google Drive to 
    Cryptpad.fr 
   

Friday, April 9
_______________________________________________________________________

* Discussion on Tahoe-LAFS' broader strategy
    Possible future plans
    Current design issues 
    Other projects and how they relate
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/project-notes/broader-strategy.txt

* What do we do with the mailing lists?
    Sajith has sent an email to info@osuosl.org, to see if they can
    advise us about fixing our mailing routing problems, or help with
    migrating to their infrastructure.
    We are also going to end-of-life the mailing list 

* Sub-topic - podcasts!
    Car Talk 
    Sajith pinged Dustyweb to do a "Tahoe Then and Now Podcast"
    Next step unclear


Tuesday, April 6
_______________________________________________________________________

* Web Dev take-home assesment/evaluation
    Making people do unpaid work without at least offering feedback is bad
        We will offer candidates the option to receive this feedback
    To avoid a subjective decision, a points system with criteria was designed
        Will be kept sekrit for now 

* Update: Release 1.15 w/ Release Manager (meejah)
    Was actually released; announced on mailing list

* Which brings us to the mailing list . . . 
    . . . 
    . . .
        
* Communicating with Ajibola (Testing and Release Manager)
    We want to hear more from him, possibly on a daily basis 
    Should use IRC/Slack and have meejah (core dev) and Jean-Paul's (core dev)
    emails
    Ideally, the release process should be a deterministic build 


Friday, April 2 
_______________________________________________________________________

* New Monthly Report: 
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/Monthly%20Reports/march-2021.md

* Web Developer hiring 
    We have designed a test, appended to 
        https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/project-notes/website.txt
    A repo has been created to receive the candidate's contributions 
        https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/web-design

* Ajibola (Testing and Release Manager) update 
    * This week's objectives will be going through the Release Checklist with 
    Sajith (core/dev). 
        Continuing w/documentation, playing w/Tahoe grid and server 
        
    * Tentative plans for the next 5+ months:
        1) Improve onboarding, using his own experience as a reflection point
            Has already noticed missing or broken paths/libraries needing update  
        2) Create or improve documentation for set-up, usage, installation
        3) Test and releasing work 
            Improve unit testing 
            Improve integration tests; perhaps look into i2p/Tor 
            Automation of processes in GitHub Actions/CI 

* Test grid discussion revisit 
    Ajibola and community member could collaborate on this
    Suggested: make sure there is a roadmap before beginning 
    It would be 1) setting up Tahoe and 2) Server infrastructure ops 
    We have the servers 
    We could plan this to take place within the next 1 - 2 months 

* Applying for funding - discussion ideas 
    Should Tahoe-LAFS start to provide funding, rather than apply for it?
    Could another strategy be to match awarded funds?

MARCH

Tuesday, March 30
_______________________________________________________________________

* We had a super productive discussion that came out of the concept of "ticket
triaging", introduced by Jean-Paul (core dev) at the last meeting 
  * meejah (core dev) has volunteered for the first edition of Ticket Triage - yay!
  * The ticket triage process will be captured and put into the Dev Guide 
    One person is assigned per week to look at the tickets that were filed in the 
    previous week and tries to place the tickets with owners and milestones.
    They will also collect tickets that might warrant further discussion to 
    present at the next meeting. Yay governance!
    Example ticket list (March 2021 tickets): https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/query?status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&time=2021-03-01..2021-03-31&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&desc=1&order=id
  * Reorganized milestones on the Trac Roadmap
    https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/roadmap
  * Also discussed:
    The recreational nature of Tahoe-LAFS participation
    Are there benefits to giving up freedom? 
    Should there be some form of project leader?
    Discussion about meeting agenda items having concrete outputs/state changes
  
* Monthly 1-on-1s with Community Manager
    These will take place informally to provide check-ins/vents/suggestions




Friday, March 26
_______________________________________________________________________

* Monthly report items
    Further development on GBS protocol
    Port is likely at 80%(!)
    txi2p situation and more testing
    Jitsi Hosting
    Testing and Release Manager hiring and onboarding
    Apply to Google Season of Docs

* Important stuff is usually captured in the form of tickets
    Future plans to consolidate knowledge into Discourse
    Suggestion to look at tickets and triage weekly (after reaching steady
    state)

* Google Season of Docs entered (fingers crossed!)
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/edit/main/project-notes/season-of-docs-2021/project-proposal.md

* Institutional memory in terms of other grants and events needs to be collected
    This could be published on the website
    Serve as a reference for other things we can apply for or participate in

* Asynchronously decide on new meeting times, with an emphasis on including
    meejah (core/dev)

* Should we adopt a tool for formal (or at least structured) HTTP API (eg GBS) specification
    Not at this time; maybe later
    Web API should be gotten rid of and documentation cleand up. That will be a 
    giant project

Tuesday, March 23
_______________________________________________________________________

* Onboarding estimate
    Complexity and uniqueness of stacks determine onboarding time 
    For reference, large companies like Uber/Google are approx. 6 months
    Tahoe is about 3 - 6 months, with some areas remaining murky for years
    Understand this idea for recruitment/retention 
* FOR REFERENCE: Org Chart and role descriptions
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/tree/main/roles
* Feature requests
    The bottleneck on feature requests is capable Tahoe developers
    Code fellowship and other initiatives can create these new devs, as current
    devs are already generally at capacity
    Aspiration can sometimes fund, if it's already a part of objectives/budget
    Otherwise, the requesting organization should have a renumeration strategy 
    It helps if the requesting organization has a Tahoe dev on their team
* Season of Docs Update Notes
    A 2nd volunteer in addition to Community Manager will be sourced, and paid
    a stipend.
    Project proposal, milestones and metrics have been chosen
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/project-notes/season-of-docs-2021/season-of-docs-notes.txt
* I2P/Tor integration/testing
    "Good unit tests solve 98% of your problems"
    i2p and Tor unit tests leave much to be desired
    removing Mock from i2p unit tests
    the possibility exists now to greatly improve txi2p testing
* GBS RFP
    Will run draft by experienced RFP readers at LA
    Scope:
        Tahoe-LAFS codebase 
        GBS doc 
        https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposed/http-storage-node-protocol.html
        URL doc
        https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications/url.html?highlight=url
        Foolscap security properties (not codebase)
        Peer authentication
            Certificate expiration time and other parameters
            Use of SPKI to provide certificate authentication properties
        Message authentication
        Message secrecy
        Transition process from Foolscap to GBS with eye to vulnerabilities
        Possible configuration of TLS parameters offering forward secrecy
        Potential current exploitable active vulnerabilities
        Potential security gaps in user interaction
        Security assumptions, potential future weaknesses in design and implementation
        Strength of existing security controls and potential improvements that could be made
        etc.
        Comparison of the Storage Protocol vs. HTTP TLS
            Because GBS copies Foolscap as closely as possible, it might inherit
            security flaws

_______________________________________________________________________

* Kick-off with Testing and Release Manager
    Emphasize use of IRC
    Reminder to make a Trac account
    First task: Try to install Tahoe, then go through the release checklist
    Sajith (dev) will be available for 30 minutes a week for four weeks to
    check-in
    May-Lee (community) will be available once weekly for four weeks to check in
* Status of Tahoe-LAFS 1.15.0
    Will be addressed asynchronously with Meejah (dev)
* GBS discussion
    Why the design chooses to use RESTful structure and our faith in SHA256
    What is the motivation behind replacing Foolscap with an HTTP-based RPC
        Performance issues - Foolscap is slow due to its complexity
        Community - Foolscap has a smaller community and therefore fewer 
        implementations, less development
        Complexity - although Foolscap offers some potentially valuable features,
        its complexity makes it hard to test and maintain
* Possible summit item: 100-year cryptography and building Tahoe on top of other
    cryptographic primitives
* Meetings are officially 45 minutes long (more than 30, less than 60)

Tuesday, March 16
_______________________________________________________________________

* We will donate $10/mo to FOSSHost
* Release/Testing Task List
    We will schedule the closest we can get to an all-hands
    First two weeks will be him trying out the release process outlined here:
    https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-checklist.html
    And caputuring his experience
* Great Black Swamp protocol pre-pre-review
    Needs to be improved as much as possible before sent to an auditing team
* New possible future role for code maintainer
    Can be structured like a fellowship (i.e., monthly stipend vs. hourly)
    Would be a great way to retain expertise of current or past contributors
    More self-directed rather than a concrete list of tasks
    Could take learnings from T & R Manager to design program
* Specifically scoped projects should get away from hourly rates
* Incoming 2021: Least Authority might have some feature requests
    Improved mutable
    Append only
    Storage plugins system


Friday, March 12
_______________________________________________________________________

* We will apply for OTF Usability Lab https://apply.opentech.fund/usability-lab/
    We are most interested in a usability audit/Testing
    Possibly this process will also illuminate aspects of User Research and UX
    design
    We'll be in touch with members of Least Authority, who did something similar
    for Magic Folder, to get guidance

* Plans for txi2p maintenance
    Notes added to ticket https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3633

* Twisted io_uring / async disk I/O
  - https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2021-March/065545.html
  - https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1546
  Jean-Paul will keep an eye out for developments and inform us
  Because what ends up in Twisted will affect Tahoe, it's important that we
  join the discussion
  The Tahoe code in this area will have to be read and understood a bit better
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/blob/master/src/allmydata/storage/server.py

* Someone has a Docker Hub account https://hub.docker.com/r/pataquets/tahoe-lafs
  We should get in touch with them and see what's up

Tuesday, March 9
_______________________________________________________________________
* May-Lee will apply for Season of Docs and ensure we participate as far as
    possible, according to our capacity.

* GitLab migration will be given real push this week.
    This first phase will be worth $2000 USD paid upon satisfactory completion
    of migration of:
        Issues(tickets)
        Issue history, including attachemnts, patches and comments
        Deliverable is a program that accomplishes that
        It should take under one business week (5 days)
    More information on the full four-phase project:
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/project-notes/gitlab-migration.txt

Friday, March 5
_______________________________________________________________________
* Jean-Paul (core/dev) has limited availability for the next two weeks

* Sajith (core/dev) continues working on the mailing list
    we have 308 subscribers

* Pre-audit meetings postponed until sometime March - May
    Cryptographers will be solicited via IRC, Discourse and mailing list
    Prospective cryptographers will be required to read:
    https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposed/http-storage-node-protocol.html
    Commit to having 2, 1 hour conversations over 1 week (remote)
    Add their perspective as another set of eyes to the protocol, including:
    What do they think could be different about the protocol?
    What might have been missed, in terms of possible issues? Opportunites?
    Is there any horrendous flaw here before we get audited?
    And generally get the protocol as honed as possible before audit

* Documentation improvements suggestions
    Less, and better written
    For now, start with topic guides
        Installation
        Consuming storage
        Providing storage
        How to run a friend net 
        Running hybrid local cloud grid, with a backup in the cloud
        Integrating Tahoe-LAFS as a storage layer in your app
    As documentation is written/tested, it can reveal ways in which Tahoe can be 
    improved, so it's a good opportunity to generate more tickets

* Community will suggest domain names, for temporary hosting
    Should come fron decentralized/freedom-supporting world

Tuesday, March 2
_______________________________________________________________________ 
* Search for a cryptographer begins
  For reference: 
  https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposed/http-storage-node-protocol.html

* Yves' skills will be useful for fixing Tahoe instrumentation related
  to deployment of Test Grid as well as assitance with a self-hosted GitLab
    He uses Ansible and our preference is NixOS
              
* Trac migration project will be offered to the community as a project
  There needs to be a coordinated means of communicating when such
  opportunities are available
    IRC
    Discourse
    Mailing list
  
* For the upcoming Summit, think of agenda topics.
  Meejah (dev) had the idea of clearing up the philosophy of ideas such
  as file deletion and how it pertains to old and new code.
    i.e., can a ever be truly guaranteed to have been deleted? is having
    such a feature therefore misleading?
  
* Website will be getting a redesign so consider "Must-have" features
  For reference: https://sajith.github.io/tahoe-website/

FEBRUARY 2021
Friday, February 26
_______________________________________________________________________  
* GitLab migration meeting w/Six Feet Up
  It is out of our budget, so we will decline
  Sajith will examine it more closely Monday and Tuesday

* Meeting w/Liz 25.02.2021
  Stronger push to inform community of opportunities w/Tahoe
  In case we can't get tahoe-lafs.org from Brian Warner, we should choose
  tahoe-lafs.xyz or other suggestions (should that be taken as well)
  Brian Warner, Daira and Zooko contacted Re: Protocol Spec
    Told meetings were going to be 2nd week of March
    If we can't get one of them, we will find a cryptographer
              
* Monthly report items
    Need help reporting for Development
      Python 3 Porting continues
      Now using Coveralls.io (instead of Codecove.io)
      Test coverage has expanded
      Jean-Paul has replaced some ancient custom code for Windows with 
      functions offered by pywin32 library
      
Tuesday, February 23
_______________________________________________________________________

* Still waiting on FOSSHost; Discourse is being worked on
       
* Onboarding new Testing and Release Manager will be done through tickets

* Summit 2021 - TBD     
    Montreal in September
    Propose agenda items here: 
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/summit-2021-suggested-agenda.txt
        
* Meeting w/Carol tomorrow w/Sajith & May-Lee

* Mailing list is kind of broken today, because the machine hosting
  tahoe-lafs.org does not do outbound email delivery well.  Jean-Paul
  and Sajith will address that problem.

* Who uses Tahoe-LAFS these days?
     Users of I2P - 1800 views on a setup post on I2p forum
     PyPi downloads
     We will get list of projects/other user details from Liz
     Likely too soon to do user surveys

February 19, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________
* RFP scheduling - Meejah, Sajith, Jean-Paul will schedule among themselves
    Best around 2nd week of March
    Need to have one cryptographer on hand
        
* Test Grid servers will be set up at a future date for users

* A short description of Tahoe-LAFS:
    "We are a FOSS decentralized file store that has been around for
    over a decade. Tahoe-LAFS creates redundant copies of parts of a
    file, encrypts them and sends them to multiple servers. This design
    allows for data privacy and security from multiple attacks."

* GitLab migration probably will take place via contractor

* Community Roadmap and Resources Document
    Add detailed Development view with links to tickets etc. on sheet 3

* We will seek to release a Python 3 supporting txip

* Financial transparency: current disclosure on BTC explorer is good for now

* Testing and Release Manager consultant position filled

February 16, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________
* BASICS hiring direction
    We decided to choose a Testing and Release person
    We will keep in touch with the other person and Jessica Rose for future
    roles

* What do we need from a Web Developer?
    We need to do the work and decide what we like
        Look at Dribbbl or Behance etc.
    Whatever they give us must be maintainable somehow
        Must use GitHub/GitLab, some kind of VCS
    Strong preference towards designer/front end
    Need a proper API
    Our main site could just be a GitLab Pages
    
* "We should have a self-hosted GitLab"
    Least Authority's GitLab migration took two days
    Should we forget about GitLab.com?

* Roadmap - tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3604
    Tahoe will possibly be ultimately a federated model
        Python 3 Porting
        Getting rid of Foolscap
        Grid Manager
        Accounting system (User IDs and Leases)
        Web UI redesign
        Append only feature
        Deletion feature

February 12, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________
* No progress on Discourse, Fosshost or Transfer of Tahoe-LAFS.org billing

* Will meet with sales person at CircleCI

* Small Grants program will worked on and then presented
    
* RFP for security audit for node specification protocol
    First step: devs block out a week of time for completion of the
    storage protocol spec. Sometime in the first half of March. Possible
    participants:
        Jean-Paul (available)
        Meejah (will ask)
        Sajith (available)
        Daira (will ask)
        Brian (will ask)

* 2021 Community Roadmap - will be expanded and published
    At least one summit
    User Test Grid
    Creating a bounties program
    Hosting a grants program (Outreachy?)
    Website/UX
    Documentation - Two foci: Developers and Users
    GitLab migration - may or may not be possible; alternatives
    GitHub presence
    Strategy for project sustainability and organic growth

February 9, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________

* What should we do with the tahoe-dev mailing list?
    We will try out hosting a forum on Discourse to take over the main
    function of the old mailing list

* Should we use a paid CircleCI account? https://circleci.com/pricing/
    We will try upgrading to a "performance" account

* Thoughts about a community-run Jitsi instance?
    We will apply to fosshost.org and try their Jitsi

* Crafting a structure for the Small Grants program
    We want to utilize resources such as Le Wagon to build a funnel
    However, we should choose appropriate tickets/projects
    Namely, Web/UI focused projects can be spun out

* We now have $250 USD/mo in the form of a credit card via Aspiration
    We will now begin to get all accounts under one account
