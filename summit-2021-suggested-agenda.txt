* IRL or Virtual?
    Preference is for IRL; we will plan for that
    If it has to be virtual, that should be an easy transition
    Also we should stream it

* Dietary suggestions
    I will guess that we have 5 - 20 attendees
    Light AM snacks, "coffee" (social aspect)
    Autonomous Lunch
    Group dinner
    
* Entertainment
    If more than 50 ppl, I suggest after party on at least one night
    If more than 100, I suggest small art event
    
* Lodging
    Each for themself?
    I (m-L) would  be interested in a space like a retreat center
      sometimes you can take over a whole BnB for this purpose
