* Testing and Release Manager notes & 'roles' folder/org chart
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/roles/testing-and-release-manager.txt
    "The release process is documented and repeatable to the extent that
    someone new to the project is able to independently generate
    the complete set of artifacts required for a release."
* How do we handle feature requests?
* Updates:
    Season of Docs - budget, ideas, 2nd person needed (can't find it but I saw 
    it https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/admin-responsibilities)
    I2P/Tor integration/testing
    GBS RFP - scope ideas needed
        Codebases? Foolscap/Tahoe-LAFS or just the GBS doc?

            Certificate discussion?
        Message authentication
        Message secrecy
        Transition process from Foolscap to GBS
        Possible configuration of TLS parameters offering forward secrecy
        Potential current exploitable active vulnerabilities
        Potential security gaps in user interaction
        Security assumptions, potential future weaknesses in design and implementation
        Strength of existing security controls and potential improvements that could be made
        etc.

Minutes of Past Meetings

MARCH

Friday, March 19
_______________________________________________________________________

* Kick-off with Testing and Release Manager
    Emphasize use of IRC
    Reminder to make a Trac account
    First task: Try to install Tahoe, then go through the release checklist
    Sajith (dev) will be available for 30 minutes a week for four weeks to
    check-in
    May-Lee (community) will be available once weekly for four weeks to check in
* Status of Tahoe-LAFS 1.15.0
    Will be addressed asynchronously with Meejah (dev)
* GBS discussion
    Why the design chooses to use RESTful structure and our faith in SHA256
    What is the motivation behind replacing Foolscap with an HTTP-based RPC
        Performance issues - Foolscap is slow due to its complexity
        Community - Foolscap has a smaller community and therefore fewer 
        implementations, less development
        Complexity - although Foolscap offers some potentially valuable features,
        its complexity makes it hard to test and maintain
* Possible summit item: 100-year cryptography and building Tahoe on top of other
    cryptographic primitives
* Meetings are officially 45 minutes long (more than 30, less than 60)

Tuesday, March 16
_______________________________________________________________________

* We will donate $10/mo to FOSSHost
* Release/Testing Task List
    We will schedule the closest we can get to an all-hands
    First two weeks will be him trying out the release process outlined here:
    https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-checklist.html
    And caputuring his experience
* Great Black Swamp protocol pre-pre-review
    Needs to be improved as much as possible before sent to an auditing team
* New possible future role for code maintainer
    Can be structured like a fellowship (i.e., monthly stipend vs. hourly)
    Would be a great way to retain expertise of current or past contributors
    More self-directed rather than a concrete list of tasks
    Could take learnings from T & R Manager to design program
* Specifically scoped projects should get away from hourly rates
* Incoming 2021: Least Authority might have some feature requests
    Improved mutable
    Append only
    Storage plugins system


Friday, March 12
_______________________________________________________________________

* We will apply for OTF Usability Lab https://apply.opentech.fund/usability-lab/
    We are most interested in a usability audit/Testing
    Possibly this process will also illuminate aspects of User Research and UX
    design
    We'll be in touch with members of Least Authority, who did something similar
    for Magic Folder, to get guidance

* Plans for txi2p maintenance
    Notes added to ticket https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3633

* Twisted io_uring / async disk I/O
  - https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2021-March/065545.html
  - https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1546
  Jean-Paul will keep an eye out for developments and inform us
  Because what ends up in Twisted will affect Tahoe, it's important that we
  join the discussion
  The Tahoe code in this area will have to be read and understood a bit better
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/blob/master/src/allmydata/storage/server.py

* Someone has a Docker Hub account https://hub.docker.com/r/pataquets/tahoe-lafs
  We should get in touch with them and see what's up

Tuesday, March 9
_______________________________________________________________________
* May-Lee will apply for Season of Docs and ensure we participate as far as
    possible, according to our capacity.

* GitLab migration will be given real push this week.
    This first phase will be worth $2000 USD paid upon satisfactory completion
    of migration of:
        Issues(tickets)
        Issue history, including attachemnts, patches and comments
        Deliverable is a program that accomplishes that
        It should take under one business week (5 days)
    More information on the full four-phase project:
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/project-notes/gitlab-migration.txt

Friday, March 5
_______________________________________________________________________
* Jean-Paul (core/dev) has limited availability for the next two weeks

* Sajith (core/dev) continues working on the mailing list
    we have 308 subscribers

* Pre-audit meetings postponed until sometime March - May
    Cryptographers will be solicited via IRC, Discourse and mailing list
    Prospective cryptographers will be required to read:
    https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposed/http-storage-node-protocol.html
    Commit to having 2, 1 hour conversations over 1 week (remote)
    Add their perspective as another set of eyes to the protocol, including:
    What do they think could be different about the protocol?
    What might have been missed, in terms of possible issues? Opportunites?
    Is there any horrendous flaw here before we get audited?
    And generally get the protocol as honed as possible before audit

* Documentation improvements suggestions
    Less, and better written
    For now, start with topic guides
        Installation
        Consuming storage
        Providing storage
        How to run a friend net 
        Running hybrid local cloud grid, with a backup in the cloud
        Integrating Tahoe-LAFS as a storage layer in your app
    As documentation is written/tested, it can reveal ways in which Tahoe can be 
    improved, so it's a good opportunity to generate more tickets

* Community will suggest domain names, for temporary hosting
    Should come fron decentralized/freedom-supporting world

Tuesday, March 2
_______________________________________________________________________ 
* Search for a cryptographer begins
  For reference: 
  https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposed/http-storage-node-protocol.html

* Yves' skills will be useful for fixing Tahoe instrumentation related
  to deployment of Test Grid as well as assitance with a self-hosted GitLab
    He uses Ansible and our preference is NixOS
              
* Trac migration project will be offered to the community as a project
  There needs to be a coordinated means of communicating when such
  opportunities are available
    IRC
    Discourse
    Mailing list
  
* For the upcoming Summit, think of agenda topics.
  Meejah (dev) had the idea of clearing up the philosophy of ideas such
  as file deletion and how it pertains to old and new code.
    i.e., can a ever be truly guaranteed to have been deleted? is having
    such a feature therefore misleading?
  
* Website will be getting a redesign so consider "Must-have" features
  For reference: https://sajith.github.io/tahoe-website/

FEBRUARY 2021
Friday, February 26
_______________________________________________________________________  
* GitLab migration meeting w/Six Feet Up
  It is out of our budget, so we will decline
  Sajith will examine it more closely Monday and Tuesday

* Meeting w/Liz 25.02.2021
  Stronger push to inform community of opportunities w/Tahoe
  In case we can't get tahoe-lafs.org from Brian Warner, we should choose
  tahoe-lafs.xyz or other suggestions (should that be taken as well)
  Brian Warner, Daira and Zooko contacted Re: Protocol Spec
    Told meetings were going to be 2nd week of March
    If we can't get one of them, we will find a cryptographer
              
* Monthly report items
    Need help reporting for Development
      Python 3 Porting continues
      Now using Coveralls.io (instead of Codecove.io)
      Test coverage has expanded
      Jean-Paul has replaced some ancient custom code for Windows with 
      functions offered by pywin32 library
      
Tuesday, February 23
_______________________________________________________________________

* Still waiting on FOSSHost; Discourse is being worked on
       
* Onboarding new Testing and Release Manager will be done through tickets

* Summit 2021 - TBD     
    Montreal in September
    Propose agenda items here: 
    https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/community/blob/main/summit-2021-suggested-agenda.txt
        
* Meeting w/Carol tomorrow w/Sajith & May-Lee

* Mailing list is kind of broken today, because the machine hosting
  tahoe-lafs.org does not do outbound email delivery well.  Jean-Paul
  and Sajith will address that problem.

* Who uses Tahoe-LAFS these days?
     Users of I2P - 1800 views on a setup post on I2p forum
     PyPi downloads
     We will get list of projects/other user details from Liz
     Likely too soon to do user surveys

February 19, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________
* RFP scheduling - Meejah, Sajith, Jean-Paul will schedule among themselves
    Best around 2nd week of March
    Need to have one cryptographer on hand
        
* Test Grid servers will be set up at a future date for users

* A short description of Tahoe-LAFS:
    "We are a FOSS decentralized file store that has been around for
    over a decade. Tahoe-LAFS creates redundant copies of parts of a
    file, encrypts them and sends them to multiple servers. This design
    allows for data privacy and security from multiple attacks."

* GitLab migration probably will take place via contractor

* Community Roadmap and Resources Document
    Add detailed Development view with links to tickets etc. on sheet 3

* We will seek to release a Python 3 supporting txip

* Financial transparency: current disclosure on BTC explorer is good for now

* Testing and Release Manager consultant position filled

February 16, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________
* BASICS hiring direction
    We decided to choose a Testing and Release person
    We will keep in touch with the other person and Jessica Rose for future
    roles

* What do we need from a Web Developer?
    We need to do the work and decide what we like
        Look at Dribbbl or Behance etc.
    Whatever they give us must be maintainable somehow
        Must use GitHub/GitLab, some kind of VCS
    Strong preference towards designer/front end
    Need a proper API
    Our main site could just be a GitLab Pages
    
* "We should have a self-hosted GitLab"
    Least Authority's GitLab migration took two days
    Should we forget about GitLab.com?

* Roadmap - tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3604
    Tahoe will possibly be ultimately a federated model
        Python 3 Porting
        Getting rid of Foolscap
        Grid Manager
        Accounting system (User IDs and Leases)
        Web UI redesign
        Append only feature
        Deletion feature

February 12, 2021

    storage protocol spec. Sometime in the first half of March. Possible
    participants:
        Jean-Paul (available)
        Meejah (will ask)
        Sajith (available)

February 9, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________

* What should we do with the tahoe-dev mailing list?
    We will try out hosting a forum on Discourse to take over the main
    function of the old mailing list

* Should we use a paid CircleCI account? https://circleci.com/pricing/
    We will try upgrading to a "performance" account

* Thoughts about a community-run Jitsi instance?
    We will apply to fosshost.org and try their Jitsi

* Crafting a structure for the Small Grants program
    We want to utilize resources such as Le Wagon to build a funnel
    However, we should choose appropriate tickets/projects
    Namely, Web/UI focused projects can be spun out

* We now have $250 USD/mo in the form of a credit card via Aspiration
    We will now begin to get all accounts under one account
