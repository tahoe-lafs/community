Goal: sustainability for projects and improving contributor diversity. Ends in
September 2021 but likely to finally wrap in March 2022. 

TODO:
Accountability report on 5th of every month
1 page update report every 3 months (the rubric can be used to guide this)

Also advance the rubric, with the following next steps:

"The project provides a well-documented, secure and private channel to report
security issues, along with a documented way of responding to them."

"The way in which contributors can be granted more rights such as commit access 
or decision power is clearly documented and is the same for all contributors.
Most code contributions of reasonable quality are accepted."

"The project has clear processes in place for managing code of conduct reports,
including a conflict of interest policy and options for reporting to different
individuals. The project actively works to welcome new contributors and uphold
a friendly environment in its communications channels."

"Documented voting rules are used to build consensus when discussion is not
sufficient."

"The project's leadership roster clearly states the roles and responsibilities
of each leader."

"The project itself contains a "help" function for users to report errors and
seek support, native to the user interface of the project/app."

"The project has a self-governing developer community deliberately supporting a
broad user community. Funding opportunities to support the project have been
identified and pursued."

"The release process is documented and repeatable to the extent that someone new
to the project is able to independently generate the complete set of artifacts
required for a release."

"Committers are bound by an Individual Contributor Agreement that defines which 
code they are allowed to commit and how they need to identify code that is not 
their own."
