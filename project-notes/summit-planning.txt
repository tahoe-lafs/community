Announce date (end of March/Beginning of April)
Create Schedule and Agenda
    Topics
    speakers 
    Goals? what do we want to know or have done after the summit 
Create budget (use the suggested amount of 10,000)
Two realities:
    All virtual (<5,000 I would say)
        -check in with all participants and esp. speakers about their set up
        (push production values here)
        -choose an optimal timezone hotspot (we span UTC -8 till UTC +1 currently)
        -design some team events
    Hybrid - IRL with streaming
        -same as above PLUS 
        -get some kind of A/V team/set-up
        -venue
            -5-30 people over 1 - 3 days
            -Montreal
            -what else do we need? projectors, seating, etc.
        -party

Another idea: We have about 4 possible "hotspots" so we could do regional IRL
and some virtual events
Central Europe/Berlin
United States/New England
"Canada"
United States/West Coast
