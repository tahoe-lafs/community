Prefer Nix over Ansible
Need to fix Tahoe instrumentation related to deployment
In order to determine if Test Grid working or not 
Also related to Allmydata.com 
Run the latest version of Tahoe
Would like monitoring
Classes of uses:    we get usage/behavior data
                    other people can use it reliably
Need to determine reasonable amount of time it can be used - one week?
6 - 12

Test grid discussion revisit 
    Ajibola and community member could collaborate on this
    Suggested: make sure there is a roadmap before beginning 
    It would be 1) setting up Tahoe and 2) Server infrastructure ops 
    We have the servers 
    We could plan this to take place within the next 1 - 2 months
