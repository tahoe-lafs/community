### Summary

March further revealed the organizational complexity of the Tahoe-LAFS project.
As a team, coordination is starting to ramp up and inertia around some issues
is starting to dissolve. There has been an ongoing sense of excitement as the
Python 3 porting project nears its close. Collecting and updating institutional
memory remains a challenge, simply because the project has a long history. It was
decided to create a role for a Code Maintainer.

We are excited to start the security auditing process soon and be able to provide
an audited project to any organization integrating Tahoe-LAFS.

In the Community:
+ 2021 Summit planning continues
+ Projects, grants and internships program begins to take shape
+ New ticket triaging process introduced by Jean-Paul (core/dev) to improve
project organization and governance
